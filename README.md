# ghost-theme-starter

This is essentially [TryGhost/Starter](https://github.com/TryGhost/Starter) with rollup instead of gulp
and a very different directory structure that I find to be a little easier to work with while developing.


## Getting started

* `git clone https://github.com/tydanel/ghost-theme-starter.git`
* `npm install`
* `npm run build`
